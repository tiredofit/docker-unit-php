## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/unit-php).

```
docker pull tiredofit/unit:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/unit/pkgs/container/unit-php)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-unit-php:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Container OS | Tag       |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Alpine       | `:latest` |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory       | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `/var/log/unit` | Logfiles    |
| `/www/html`     | Web root    |
* * *
### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |
| [Unit](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-unit/)      | Unit Base Image                        |

#### Container Options

| Variable | Value | Default |
| -------- | ----- | ------- |

### Networking

| Port | Protocol | Description    |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| `80` | `http`   | Unit Webserver |

## Maintenance
### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is) bash
```
## Support
